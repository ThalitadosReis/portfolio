    "paragraph1": "Hey! I'm Thalita, a full-stack developer in Zürich who loves building things and figuring out how stuff works. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me hiking somewhere beautiful, trying to recreate a dish I had on my last trip, or experimenting in the kitchen. There's something satisfying about both cooking and coding, that mix of following a structure while adding your own twist.",
    "paragraph2": "I spent years in hospitality before moving into tech, and honestly, it taught me so much about reading people, staying calm when things get chaotic, and working with all kinds of personalities. Those skills show up in unexpected ways, like when I'm collaborating on a project or thinking through how someone will actually use what I'm building.",
    "paragraph3": "Right now, I'm focused on growing as a developer and finding teams where people care about learning and trying new things. I want to work on projects that matter and keep pushing myself to get better. If that sounds like your vibe, let's chat!"
